# PythonGuitarPractice

This is a little program to help with my jazz guitar practice. The idea is to generate exercises related (mostly) to scales, patterns and arrpegios on random keys, where the guitarist is required to play on random parts of the fretboard, starting on random strings with random fingers. In the long run, this highly improved my perception of the fretboard and helped me with my scales and arpeggios.

Although I conceived the idea, the code was written by a myopic monkey with one hand during an afternoon, and it is not meant to be read by human beings; this is just a proof of concept which will be hopefully rewritten from scratch one day. If you must, just run it and follow the instructions. 

If latex is installed, it can generate a nice pdf file (add the -t flag; see sample_output.pdf).
