# PythonGuitarPractice

This is a little program to help with my jazz guitar practice. The idea to generate exercises related (mostly) to scales, patterns and arrpegios on random keys, where the guitarist is required to play on random parts of the fretboard, starting on random strings with random fingers. A lot of random stuff.

Although I conceived the idea, the code was written by a myopic monkey with one hand, and it is not meant to be read by humans; this is just a proof of concept. Just run it and follow the instructions, if you can. If latex is installed, it can generate a nice pdf file (add the -t flag; see sample_output.pdf).
